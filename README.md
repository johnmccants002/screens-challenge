# Screens Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Screens Challenge" repository! This project is a unique and exciting journey into the world of front-end development, specifically focusing on React Native. The core idea of this repository is to recreate popular mobile app screens from scratch. Each screen is a tribute to the app it represents, showcasing not only the visual fidelity but also the functionality and responsiveness that modern apps offer.

## Project Structure

- **Screens Directory**: Contains the recreated screens from various popular apps.
- **Examples Directory**: Includes the original screenshots from the apps for comparison.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation for each screen, explaining the components and logic used.

## How It Works

1. **Explore Original Screens**: Start by browsing through the 'Examples' directory to see the collection of screenshots from well-known mobile apps.
2. **Check Out Recreations**: Navigate to the 'Screens' directory to view our recreations of these screens using React Native.
3. **Interactive Selection**: The first screen of the app presents a list of available screens. Users can select any screen to view our recreation.
4. **Side-by-Side Comparison**: For each recreated screen, you can see a side-by-side comparison with the original screenshot, highlighting our attention to detail and fidelity.

## Goals and Learning Outcomes

- **Showcasing Front-End Skills**: This project serves as a portfolio to demonstrate front-end development skills, particularly in React Native.
- **Learning by Doing**: By recreating popular app screens, contributors can learn and understand the nuances of professional app design and front-end development.
- **Community Collaboration**: Encourages contributions and suggestions from the community, fostering a collaborative learning environment.
